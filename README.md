This projects goal is to develop a Darts Score keeper app that can be played with multiple players to the scores of
'301' or '501'. In addition the Score Keeper app will have legs implemented to play multiple rounds. 

This game has error handling and will display the score board actively with real-time score. After a winner has been found that will be told in the display. 

Also we wanted to keep the visual side as sharp as possible. There are many visual implementations to make the User Experience exceptional. ;)

1. cd into the darts-scorekeeper folder 
2. Type in the terminal:
     ' npm start in console starts the app ' 
3. All done! Enjoy your time playing!
